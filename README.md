In my web technology course work I have chosen Kamolon polov center. Since they do not have their own website I decided to make one for them. On my website I have not used that much JS since I had some trouble understanding some topics. I used it for navbar and search buttons. I struggled to find my design because they do not have their own website that was why I had to make sure it was a write type for the restaurant website. I had to look for lots of online tutorials in order to have the right understanding of the restaurant website. I have chosen netlify to host my website because it offers free and fast hosting. One of the main and struggling problems that I had was the media query mainly the mobile version of my game again I found some tutorials online that were very well explained. It really helped me to have an understanding of the responsive page.
